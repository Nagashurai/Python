This is a program that will automate the "transactions.xlsx" file and save information in Column "D" as well as create a chart for the data in "e2". Technically the file name could be anything with how I wrote this as long as the file destination is correct and "Sheet1" exists with data.

This was a guided project with a few deviations of my own to understand the concept of Excel integration with Python so that functions could be automated
