This is API integration for a Weather Python program. This is created to integrate any locations weather based off of your computers time zone without conversions. If a conversion is required you must do it manually since this is a program meant for API integration.

The custom API code will need to be entered for this to work. Mine was removed for uploading purposes so this will not run on its own.
